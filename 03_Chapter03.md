# Chapter 3: Creating and Publishing Ebooks

Welcome back to our continuing journey into the world of ebooks. In the previous chapter, we explored the different formats and standards, and learned how they affect the reading experience. Now, we will be focusing on the exciting process of creating and publishing an ebook for the world to enjoy.

Creating and publishing an ebook can seem like a daunting task, but fear not, dear reader, because we have a special guest to guide us through the process. We are pleased to welcome Mark Coker, founder of Smashwords, an online ebook publishing and distribution platform. With over a decade of experience in the industry, Mark has helped thousands of authors successfully create and distribute their ebooks.

But before we dive in, let's take a moment to look at some interesting facts about ebook publishing:

- The first ebook was created in 1971 by Michael Hart, founder of Project Gutenberg, and contained the text of the US Declaration of Independence.

- In 2019, Amazon reported that over 490,000 books were self-published on their platform.

- According to a report by Statista, ebook revenue worldwide is expected to reach 18.9 billion dollars by 2026.

Now, let's get back to the topic at hand. Creating and publishing an ebook involves several key steps:

### Step 1: Writing and Formatting

The first step is to write your ebook and format it to meet the requirements of the publishing platform. This involves converting your manuscript into a format that is compatible with different devices and platforms. Common formats include EPUB, MOBI, and PDF.

### Step 2: Designing and Cover Art

The second step is designing a cover that will catch the attention of potential readers. A good cover should be eye-catching and give readers an idea of what the book is about. You can choose to design your own cover or hire a professional designer.

### Step 3: Publishing and Distribution

The final step is publishing and distributing your ebook. This involves uploading your ebook to an online platform, such as Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, Apple Books, or Smashwords, and making it available to readers around the world.

## The Curse of the Unpublished Ebook

Once upon a time, in the land of aspiring authors, there lived a young writer named Lucy. Lucy had always dreamed of becoming a published author but didn't know where to start. One day, she met a mysterious figure who promised to help her publish her ebook, but at a steep cost. Lucy hesitated, but her desire to see her name in print clouded her judgment, and she accepted the offer.

She submitted her manuscript and waited eagerly for it to be published. However, weeks turned to months, and there was no news from the publishing platform. She tried to contact them, but they did not respond. Finally, she decided to investigate and discovered that the publishing platform was a sham, and her ebook was lost in the abyss of the internet.

Lucy was devastated, but she refused to give up on her dream. She turned to the internet and stumbled upon a platform called Smashwords, where she met Mark Coker, the founder. With his expert guidance and patience, she learned the proper way to create an ebook and publish it successfully.

Finally, the importance of choosing the right publishing platform cannot be overstated. Smashwords, for instance, allows authors to publish and distribute their ebooks to multiple retailers and access valuable tools and support to increase the likelihood of success.

## The Curse of the Unpublished Ebook - Code Explanation

In the Dracula story of Chapter 3, we explore the journey of a young writer, Lucy, who falls prey to the allure of a publishing scam that almost deprives her of her dreams. However, she finds salvation in Smashwords and Mark Coker's expert guidance.

Let's take a closer look at the key knowledge that helped Lucy resolve her story and take control of her publishing journey:

### 1. Correct Formatting

The first lesson we learn is the critical importance of proper formatting while creating an ebook. Correct formatting ensures a seamless reading experience without any hiccups. The following code snippet shows an example of formatting styles used in EPUB 3:

```css
body {
  font-family: "Open Sans", Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1em;
  line-height: 1.5;
  text-align: justify;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2em;
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 0.67em;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 1.5em;
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 0.83em;
}

p {
  margin-top: 0;
  margin-bottom: 1em;
}
```

This CSS snippet shows the formatting styles for the body, heading 1, heading 2, and paragraphs in an EPUB 3 ebook. It defines the font family, font size, line height, and margins for different elements of the ebook. Proper formatting ensures that your ebook looks professional and is easily readable on different devices.

### 2. Cover Art

The next critical lesson we learned is the importance of an attractive and professional ebook cover. The cover is like a window to your ebook, giving potential readers a glimpse of what's inside. The following code snippet shows an example of how to create a cover page in an EPUB 3 ebook:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
    <title>My Ebook Title</title>
    <style type="text/css">
        /* Define cover page styles */
        div.cover {
            text-align: center;
            margin-top: 10%;
        }
        div.title {
            font-size: 42px;
            font-weight: bold;
            text-transform: uppercase;
            margin-bottom: 30px;
        }
        div.author {
            font-size: 28px;
            margin-bottom: 20px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="cover">
        <img src="cover.jpg" alt="Cover"/>
        <div class="title">My Ebook Title</div>
        <div class="author">by John Doe</div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

This HTML code snippet shows the basic structure of a cover page for an EPUB 3 ebook. It includes an image of the cover, the title, and the author's name. A well-designed cover can catch a reader's attention and encourage them to buy and read your ebook.

### 3. Choosing the Right Platform

Finally, the story emphasizes the importance of choosing the right platform to publish and distribute your ebook. There are many options out there, each with its strengths and weaknesses. For example, Smashwords is a platform that provides authors with tools and support to help them optimize and distribute their ebooks.

Here's an example code snippet of how to create a basic EPUB 3 ebook using Smashwords:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
    <title>My Ebook Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc eleifend, mauris vel suscipit bibendum, ipsum nisi vulputate sapien, vel tristique arcu nibh vel eros.</p>
    <h2>Section 1.1</h2>
    <p>Phasellus nec semper nisl. In viverra consectetur lorem nec ultricies. Suspendisse potenti. Proin ac felis dui.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

This basic HTML code snippet shows the structure of an ebook with a title and two sections already present in it. Using platforms such as Smashwords can be useful for eCommerce analytics, managing metadata, and formatting assurance, ensuring no error in publishing.

With these key lessons in mind, you now have the information you need to create and publish your very own ebook.
